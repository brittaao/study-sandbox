# Interactive visualizations of probability distributions
Probability theory is the foundation of data science and many other scientific disciplines.
I created a number of interactive matplotlib widgets on probability distributions common in data science
in order to visualize what happens when you tweak parameters and inputs of these functions. 

```{note}
The output in this jupyter book will unfortunately not be interactive. This is because the widgets require 
a running python kernel, but jupyter books renders markdown and .ipynb files into html (so no Python 
kernel running).
```
